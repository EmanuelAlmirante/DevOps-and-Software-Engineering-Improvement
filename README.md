# DevOps and Software Engineering Improvement

This repository has the objective to aggretate material about DevOps and Software development in order to help readers to improve these skills and discover new technologies. This repository is not intended to have a project, only to serve as an introduction to tecnhologies used in IT companies. 

Anyone can contribute with material and add links of your repositories/projects.  

## Getting Started

Read the README, first of all.

Add anything you feel is relevant to this repository.

Maintain the formatting.

When adding a tecnhology, please try to add the documentation of that tecnhology, a YouTube tutorial, and a book of that tecnhology.

In the section Algorithms, please every one that you know of, if it is not there. Include a link to the algorithm (Wikipedia page, for example) and a link to an example of it (this section is currently under construction).

This README is still a work in progress, some things might not be complete, but will be in a near future.

## Motivation

## Technologies 

### Docker (https://www.docker.com/)

Docker is the company driving the container movement and the only container platform provider to address every application across the hybrid cloud. Todayâ€™s businesses are under pressure to digitally transform but are constrained by existing applications and infrastructure while rationalizing an increasingly diverse portfolio of clouds, datacenters and application architectures. Docker enables true independence between applications and infrastructure and developers and IT ops to unlock their potential and creates a model for better collaboration and innovation.

### Git (https://git-scm.com/)

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows.

### Java (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)

Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE) lets you develop and deploy Java applications on desktops and servers. Java offers the rich user interface, performance, versatility, portability, and security that today's applications require.

### Apache Kafka (https://kafka.apache.org/)

Apache Kafka is an open-source stream processing platform developed by the Apache Software Foundation written in Scala and Java. The project aims to provide a unified, high-throughput, low-latency platform for handling real-time data feeds. Its storage layer is essentially a "massively scalable pub/sub message queue architected as a distributed transaction log, "making it highly valuable for enterprise infrastructures to process streaming data. Additionally, Kafka connects to external systems (for data import/export) via Kafka Connect and provides Kafka Streams, a Java stream processing library.

### Elasticsearch (https://www.elastic.co/)

Elasticsearch is a search engine based on Lucene. It provides a distributed, multitenant-capable full-text search engine with an HTTP web interface and schema-free JSON documents. Elasticsearch is developed in Java and is released as open source under the terms of the Apache License. Official clients are available in Java, .NET (C#), PHP, Python, Apache Groovy and many other languages. According to the DB-Engines ranking, Elasticsearch is the most popular enterprise search engine followed by Apache Solr, also based on Lucene. Elasticsearch is developed alongside a data-collection and log-parsing engine called Logstash, and an analytics and visualisation platform called Kibana. The three products are designed for use as an integrated solution, referred to as the "Elastic Stack" (formerly the "ELK stack").

### Kibana (https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana)

Kibana lets you visualize your Elasticsearch data and navigate the Elastic Stack, so you can do anything from learning why you're getting paged at 2:00 a.m. to understanding the impact rain might have on your quarterly numbers.

### Puppet (https://puppet.com/)

In computing, Puppet is an open-source software configuration management tool. It runs on many Unix-like systems as well as on Microsoft Windows, and includes its own declarative language to describe system configuration. Puppet is produced by Puppet, founded by Luke Kanies in 2005. It is written in C++ & Clojure and released as free software under the GNU General Public License (GPL) until version 2.7.0 and the Apache License 2.0 after that.
