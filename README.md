# DevOps and Software Engineering Improvement

This repository has the objective to aggretate material about DevOps and Software development in order to help readers to improve these skills and discover new technologies. This repository is not intended to have a project, only to serve as an introduction to tecnhologies used in IT companies. 

Anyone can contribute with material and add links of your repositories/projects.  

## Getting Started

Read the README, first of all.

Add anything you feel is relevant to this repository.

Maintain the formatting.

When adding a tecnhology, please try to add the documentation of that tecnhology, a YouTube tutorial, and a book of that tecnhology. If there is not a book, just repeat the link for the documentation.

In the section Algorithms, please every one that you know of, if it is not there. Include a link to the algorithm (Wikipedia page, for example) and a link to an example of it (this section is currently under construction).

This README is still a work in progress, some things might not be complete, but will be in a near future.

## Motivation

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

## Technologies 

### Docker (https://www.docker.com/)

Docker is the company driving the container movement and the only container platform provider to address every application across the hybrid cloud. Today’s businesses are under pressure to digitally transform but are constrained by existing applications and infrastructure while rationalizing an increasingly diverse portfolio of clouds, datacenters and application architectures. Docker enables true independence between applications and infrastructure and developers and IT ops to unlock their potential and creates a model for better collaboration and innovation.

### Git (https://git-scm.com/)

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows.

### Apache Kafka (https://kafka.apache.org/)

Apache Kafka is an open-source stream processing platform developed by the Apache Software Foundation written in Scala and Java. The project aims to provide a unified, high-throughput, low-latency platform for handling real-time data feeds. Its storage layer is essentially a "massively scalable pub/sub message queue architected as a distributed transaction log, "making it highly valuable for enterprise infrastructures to process streaming data. Additionally, Kafka connects to external systems (for data import/export) via Kafka Connect and provides Kafka Streams, a Java stream processing library.

### Elasticsearch (https://www.elastic.co/)

Elasticsearch is a search engine based on Lucene. It provides a distributed, multitenant-capable full-text search engine with an HTTP web interface and schema-free JSON documents. Elasticsearch is developed in Java and is released as open source under the terms of the Apache License. Official clients are available in Java, .NET (C#), PHP, Python, Apache Groovy and many other languages. According to the DB-Engines ranking, Elasticsearch is the most popular enterprise search engine followed by Apache Solr, also based on Lucene. Elasticsearch is developed alongside a data-collection and log-parsing engine called Logstash, and an analytics and visualisation platform called Kibana. The three products are designed for use as an integrated solution, referred to as the "Elastic Stack" (formerly the "ELK stack").

### Sonatype Nexus (https://www.sonatype.com/nexus-repository-sonatype)

Nexus is a repository manager. It allows you to proxy, collect, and manage your dependencies so that you are not constantly juggling a collection of JARs. It makes it easy to distribute your software. Internally, you configure your build to publish artifacts to Nexus and they then become available to other developers. You get the benefits of having your own 'central', and there is no easier way to collaborate.

## Algorithms

An algorithm is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. Algorithms can perform calculation, data processing and automated reasoning tasks. An algorithm is an effective method that can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time and in a well-defined formal language for calculating a function.

### Graph Algorithms 

A graph is an abstract notation used to represent the connection between pairs of objects. A graph consists of vertices, which are interconnected objects in a graph, also known as nodes, and edges, which are the links that connect the vertices.

Dynamic programming (also known as dynamic optimization) is a method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions.

### Geometrical and Network Flow Algorithms

A geometric network is an object commonly used in geographic information systems to model a series of interconnected features. A geometric network is similar to a graph in mathematics and computer science, and can be described and analyzed using theories and concepts similar to graph theory. Geometric networks are often used to model road networks and public utility networks (such as electric, gas, and water utilities).

### Data Structures

A data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.
