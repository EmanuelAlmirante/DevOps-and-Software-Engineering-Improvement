# DevOps and Software Engineering Improvement

This repository has the objective to aggretate material about DevOps and Software development in order to help readers to improve these skills and discover new technologies. 

Anyone can contribute with material and add links of your repositories/projects. 

## Getting Started

Read the README, first of all.

Add anything you feel is relevant to this repository.

Maintain the formatting.

When adding a tecnhologie, please try to add the documentation of that tecnhologie, a YouTube tutorial, and a book of that tecnhologie.

This README is still a work in progress, some things might not be complete, but will be in a near future.

## Technologies 

* Docker (https://www.docker.com/)

Docker is the company driving the container movement and the only container platform provider to address every application across the hybrid cloud. Todayâ€™s businesses are under pressure to digitally transform but are constrained by existing applications and infrastructure while rationalizing an increasingly diverse portfolio of clouds, datacenters and application architectures. Docker enables true independence between applications and infrastructure and developers and IT ops to unlock their potential and creates a model for better collaboration and innovation.

* Git (https://git-scm.com/)

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows.
